# MeteorStorm
A game made with pygame

This game is written in python with pygame library and made use of concepts like modules, OOP and more. Game is basicly played with a spaceship shooting lazers in some numbers based on what your gunLevel is. In the game, to level up your lazer guns and their numbers, you should pick the red gifts that are falling down. To stay alive you should avoid the spinning meteors that I wrote with rotate function and other functional codes in RoundMeteor class -which is not inherited anything from Meteor class, and the flaring meteors. Spinning and rotating meteors has much score to offer you comparing to yellow flaring tailed meteors.
